Write a HTML page parser which recognizes bikes geometry table format and saves this geometry data in a CSV file.
The result should be a function in the module
bike_geometry_comparator/ingest/webscraper/specialized.py
which accepts 2 parameters: path to HTML file to parse and output csv file path

As an example consider this HTML file: build/tarmac.html

Some hints:
- if original geometry chart has sizes as columns they should be pivoted. Sizes should be represented like other metics columns
in the resulting CSV
- geometry metrics should be lower-case letters, spaces replaced by underscore
- "mm" suffix of metrics values should be cut
- values of metrics which represent angles should be cleaned ('°' suffix cut and comma replaced by dot)
- csv newline separator should be `\n` without CR character
- invoke any python scripts via `uv` package manager
